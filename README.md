# Countdown Timer with React

This is another experiment with [React](facebook.github.io/react/) creating a countdown timer counting down to a pre-specified date.

The current time is being converted to a hex value and used to subtly change the background color. Inspired by Jack Hughes' [Color Clock](http://thecolourclock.co.uk/).
